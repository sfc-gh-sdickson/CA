When building Snowflake Intelligence solutions, use this Github Repo as a template: @https://github.com/sfc-gh-sdickson/GoDaddy

SQL Verification Process (MANDATORY):
Before writing ANY SQL statement:
1. State what you're about to do
2. Show verification by citing specific file and line numbers
3. List exact columns/syntax found in those files
4. Ask for confirmation
5. ONLY THEN write the Snowflake SQL

If you cannot verify something:
- STOP immediately
- State: "I cannot verify [X]. I need [specific documentation/file] before proceeding."
- Do NOT guess or assume
- Do NOT proceed until verification is provided

Always verify and test Snowflake SQL syntax.  All SQL should always be 100% Snowflake SQL Syntax.
